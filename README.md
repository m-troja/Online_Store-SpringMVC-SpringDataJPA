# 🛒 Online Store Backend

A modular, production-grade backend system for an online store, built using Java 17 and the Spring Framework ecosystem. This project follows domain-driven design principles and clean architecture by splitting the application into well-defined modules: `core`, `persistence`, and `web`.

Designed for scalability, maintainability, and clarity, this backend serves as a robust foundation for building modern e-commerce applications.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The application is divided into the following core modules:

### `core` – Domain & Business Logic
This module defines the essential building blocks of the system:
- Domain entities (e.g., `Product`, `Order`, `User`)
- Business rules and core services
- Interfaces (ports) for infrastructure-level interactions

### `persistence` – Database Layer
Implements the infrastructure layer using Spring Data JPA. Responsibilities include:
- Repository definitions
- JPA entities and mappings
- Transactional operations
- Configuration of database access (e.g., PostgreSQL, H2)

### `web` – API & Web Layer
Exposes the application's functionality via RESTful endpoints:
- Spring Boot entry point
- Controllers with request/response DTOs
- Global exception handling and validation
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (planned)

This separation of concerns enables isolated testing, easier onboarding, and more agile development workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular Design**  
  Cleanly separated layers for domain, persistence, and presentation.

- **RESTful API**  
  Provides endpoints to manage core business entities such as products, users, and orders.

- **Validation and Error Handling**  
  Uses `javax.validation` annotations and centralized exception handling to deliver clean error messages and enforce input integrity.

- **DTO Mapping**  
  Uses custom mappers (or MapStruct if added) to separate internal models from API contracts.

- **Persistence with JPA**  
  Entities are persisted using Spring Data JPA, supporting relational databases.

- **Configuration Abstraction**  
  Externalized configuration supports different profiles for development, testing, and production.

- **Logging & Monitoring**  
  Structured logging via SLF4J and logback is supported for traceability and debugging.
